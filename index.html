<h1>Fish</h1>
 <p>Approximately 45% of all vertebrate species are fish. In fact, there are more species of fish than there are of mammals, reptiles and birds combined!
  <ul>
   <li>Mammals - 5,400 species</li>
   <li>Reptiles - 10,700 species</li>
   <li>Birds - 10,000 species</li>
   <li>Amphibians - 7,000 species</li>
   <li><strong>Fish - 28,000 species</strong></li>
 </ul></p>
 <p><strong>Fish Evolution</strong><br>
 We share a common ancestory with fish. Vertebrates are animals with a spinal cord. The first vertebrates appeared about 500 million years ago. These would have been very primative fish, much like modern-day hagfish. Vertebrates diverged into two lineages. The <strong>cyclostoms</strong> remained jawless. The <strong>gnathostoms</strong> developed jaws. The gnathostomes diverged into the <strong>osteichthyes</strong> (bony fish) and the <strong>chondrichthyes</strong> (cartilagenous fish, i.e. sharks, rays and skates). One group of osteichthyes gave rise to most modern fish. Another group gave rise to all four limbed vertebrates that would eventually conquor the land, including mankind.
 </p>
 <p><strong>Bony Fish (Osteichthyans)</strong><br>
  Also known as <strong>teleosts</strong>, this group is extremely diverse and makes up the majority of fish on the planet. They have hard bony skeletons much like we do. They have conquored both the marine and freshwater environment. About 60% of species live in the ocean. They have a special organ called a swim bladder that is used to control buoyancy as they swim. The swim bladder contains air that gets pumped into a sack when pressure increases. This helps to keep the fish neutrally buoyant so that they don't sink.
 </p>
 <p><strong>Cartilagenous Fish (Chondrichthyans)</strong><br>
  Also known as <strong>elasmobranchs</strong>, this group consists of all sharks and rays, as well as a few other groups such as the skates and guitar fish. About 95% of elasmobranch species are marine and they are exclusively carnivorous (with the exception of the bonnethead shark which can eat grass!). Unlike bony fish, elasmobranchs do not have swim bladders. Instead they control their buoyancy with a fatty substance called squalene. The deeper they go, the more squalene must be produced to stay neutrally buoyant. Elasmobranchs also have a special ability to detect electric signals in the water and this can help them detect prey and predators.

  <h2>Circulatory System</h2>
  <p>Mammals have a circulatory system that sends blood from the heart to the lungs to pick up oxygen, then returns it back to the heart before pumping it round the body to deliver the oxygen to other prgans. In contrast, fish blood goes straight from the gills to the rest of the body before returning to the heart. Most fish need constant movement to allow a fresh flow of oxygen to continuously enter the gills. This means many species need to keep swimming. Others may rest but 'pulse' their gills as they do so.</p>
  
  <h2>Fish Herbivory</h2>
  <p>Herbivory is important for removing algae to facilitate coral growth. Only 10-25% of reef fish species are herbivorous but they tend to dominate in terms of biomass. They are most common in shallow waters as they feed on photosynthetic organisms. On shallow reefs some herbivorous fish have been observed to take over 150,000 bites per meter per day. Provided that their overall biomass is high enough, they can consume nearly half of the daily net algal growth. There are a few types of herbivory among fish...</p>
  <p><strong>Scrapers</strong><br>
    E.g. small parrotfish, surgeonfish and rabbitfish. They take algae off the surface of hard substrates, feeding off epilithic turf algae and taking small bits of the substrate with them. If you are on the reef and hear crackles, this may be the sound of scrapers removing the algae from the surface of the coral.</p>
  <p><strong>Bioeroders</strong><br>
    E.g. large parrotfish. It is important for maintaining reef health by removing algae from the reef but also removing chunks of the substrate and therefore contributing to bioerosion. This is good because bioeroders remove dead coral and expose the underlying reef matrix that is then available for coral recruitment. Some bioeroders do eat live coral but the majority do not.</p>
  <p><strong>Grazers</strong><br>
    E.g. surgeonfish, rabbitfish and small angelfish. They also remove epithilic algae but do not ingest the substrate itself and therefore do not contribute to bioerosion. The majority of their diet is not algae but they do make a significiant contribution to keeping algae down.</p>
  <p><strong>Browsers</strong><br>
    E.g. chubs. These fish eat larger macroalgae and therefore help to reduce its standing biomass. This helps to prevent the shading canopy effect of the algae, therefore helping more sunlight reach coral for photosynthesis. It also opens up space available for coral.</p>
  <p><strong>Farming</strong><br>
    Farming is an activity carried out by many damselfish species. They maintain "gardens" of roughly 1 squared meter. They do this by manipulating their territories in order to grow a desired algae as a monoculture, by removing other unwanted organisms from the area. They are thought to excrete metabolic waste products onto their territories that facilitates the continued fast growth of their crops. They are very aggressive and therefore also deter other fish that may graze on the algae.</p>

  <h2>Fish Predation</h2>
  <p><strong>Piscivores</strong><br>
    'Fish eaters'</p>
  <p><strong>Invertivores</strong><br>
    'Invertebrate eaters'</p>
  <p><strong>Parasitivores<strong><br>
    This is a branch of invertivores that eat parasites of other species. This is very imporant for the health of the reef community as parasites often carry disease and reduce the energy of the host.</p>  
  <p><strong>Planktivores</strong><br>
    'Plankton eaters'</p>
  <p><strong>Coralivores</strong><br>
    'Coral eaters'</p>
    <p><strong>Ambush</strong><br>
      Ambush predators are patient. They spend their time conserving energy and will wait for prey to come to them.</p>

  <h2>Fish Families</h2>
  <p>Even if you cannot identify a fish species, you can often identify it's family. Members of the same family typically share common shapes and other characteristics. Below are some of the most common fish families seen on coral reefs, but there are more.</p>
  <p><strong>Angelfish</strong><br>
    Laterally compressed. Oval-shaped in front half but roughly rectangular in the bottom half.</p>
  <p><strong>Grunt</strong><br>
    Rounded on top, slightly flatter on bottom</p>
  <p><strong>Surgeonfish</strong><br>
    Laterally compressed. More rounded from the side than the angelfish. Long faces (i.e. eyes quite high above the mouth).</p>
  <p><strong>Butterflyfish</strong><br>
    Laterally compressed like angelfish, but generally noticeably smaller and more oval-shaped.</p>
  <p><strong>Parrotfish</strong><br>
    Less laterally compressed. Quite a prominent mouth. Pectoral fins are quite active when swimming.</p>
  <p><strong>Triggerfish</strong><br>
    Have prominent fins above and below tail that are almost roughly symmetrical.</p>
  <p><strong>Damselfish</strong><br>
    Generic goldfish shape. Fins are quite rounded.</p>
  <p><strong>Serranids</strong><br>
    These include the groupers, hamlets and bass. Not at all laterally compressed. Generally quite large mouths useful fo sucking in prey.</p>
  <p><strong>Wrasse</strong><br>
    Cigar-shaped</p>
