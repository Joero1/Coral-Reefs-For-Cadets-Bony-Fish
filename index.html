  <h2>Fish Evolution</h2>
 <p>We share a common ancestory with fish. Vertebrates are animals with a spinal cord. The first vertebrates appeared about 500 million years ago. These would have been very primative fish, much like modern-day hagfish. Vertebrates diverged into two lineages. The <strong>cyclostoms</strong> remained jawless. The <strong>gnathostoms</strong> developed jaws. The gnathostomes diverged into the <strong>osteichthyes</strong> (bony fish) and the <strong>chondrichthyes</strong> (cartilagenous fish, i.e. sharks, rays and skates). One group of osteichthyes gave rise to most modern fish. Another group gave rise to all four limbed vertebrates that would eventually conquor the land, including mankind.</p>

  <h2>There are Two Types of Fish...</h2>
  <p><strong>Bony Fish (Osteichthyans)</strong><br>
  Also known as <strong>teleosts</strong>, this group is extremely diverse and makes up the majority of fish on the planet. They have hard bony skeletons much like we do. They have conquored both the marine and freshwater environment. About 60% of species live in the ocean. They have a special organ called a swim bladder that is used to control buoyancy as they swim. The swim bladder contains air that gets pumped into a sack when pressure increases. This helps to keep the fish neutrally buoyant so that they don't sink.</p>

  <p><strong>Cartilagenous Fish (Chondrichthyans)</strong><br>
  Also known as <strong>elasmobranchs</strong>, this group consists of all sharks and rays, as well as a few other groups such as the skates and guitar fish. About 95% of elasmobranch species are marine and they are exclusively carnivorous (with the exception of the bonnethead shark which can eat grass!). Unlike bony fish, elasmobranchs do not have swim bladders. Instead they control their buoyancy with a fatty substance called squalene. The deeper they go, the more squalene must be produced to stay neutrally buoyant. Elasmobranchs also have a special ability to detect electric signals in the water and this can help them detect prey and predators.</p>

  <h2>Circulatory System</h2>
  <p>Mammals have a circulatory system that sends blood from the heart to the lungs to pick up oxygen, then returns it back to the heart before pumping it round the body to deliver the oxygen to other organs.</p> 
        <p>In contrast, fish blood goes straight from the gills to the rest of the body before returning to the heart. Most fish need constant movement to allow a fresh flow of oxygen to continuously enter the gills. This means many species need to keep swimming. Others may rest but 'pulse' their gills as they do so.</p>

      <div style="border: solid 2px gray; padding: 0px 35px 10px 35px;">
  <h2>Fish Herbivory</h2>
  <p>Herbivory is important for removing algae to facilitate coral growth. Only 10-25% of reef fish species are herbivorous but they tend to dominate in terms of biomass. They are most common in shallow waters as they feed on photosynthetic organisms. On shallow reefs some herbivorous fish have been observed to take over 150,000 bites per meter per day. Provided that their overall biomass is high enough, they can consume nearly half of the daily net algal growth. There are a few types of herbivory among fish...</p>
  <p><strong>Scrapers</strong><br>
    E.g. small parrotfish, surgeonfish and rabbitfish. They take algae off the surface of hard substrates, feeding off epilithic turf algae and taking small bits of the substrate with them. If you are on the reef and hear crackles, this may be the sound of scrapers removing the algae from the surface of the coral.</p>

  <p><strong>Bioeroders</strong><br>
    E.g. large parrotfish. It is important for maintaining reef health by removing algae from the reef but also removing chunks of the substrate and therefore contributing to bioerosion. This is good because bioeroders remove dead coral and expose the underlying reef matrix that is then available for coral recruitment. Some bioeroders do eat live coral but the majority do not.</p>
  <img src="https://marinebio.org/wp-content/uploads/species/Scarus-coelestinus/7.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <p><strong>Grazers</strong><br>
    E.g. surgeonfish, rabbitfish and small angelfish. They also remove epithilic algae but do not ingest the substrate itself and therefore do not contribute to bioerosion. The majority of their diet is not algae but they do make a significiant contribution to keeping algae down.</p>

  <p><strong>Browsers</strong><br>
    E.g. chubs. These fish eat larger macroalgae and therefore help to reduce its standing biomass. This helps to prevent the shading canopy effect of the algae, therefore helping more sunlight reach coral for photosynthesis. It also opens up space available for coral.</p>
  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/thumb2/chub5.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <p><strong>Farming</strong><br>
    Farming is an activity carried out by many damselfish species. They maintain "gardens" of roughly 1 squared meter. They do this by manipulating their territories in order to grow a desired algae as a monoculture, by removing other unwanted organisms from the area. They are thought to excrete metabolic waste products onto their territories that facilitates the continued fast growth of their crops. They are very aggressive and therefore also deter other fish that may graze on the algae.</p>

  <h2>Life Cycle of (Bony) Fish</h2>
  <p>Fish eggs are commonly laid in the thousands to millions. However only a very small fraction of these will survive to adulthood. The eggs often drift in the sea as part of the plankton for many weeks before hatching. Once they hatch, the juvenile fish (or 'fry') are usually just a few millimeters long, even if they will eventually grow into a large adult. The life span of reef fish varies from a few years to several decades. For example, parrotfish live 5-6 years. Groupers can live up to 37 years.</p>

  <h2>Camouflage</h2>
  <p>Camouflage is useful for either avoiding predators or for catching prey before they notice the predator. On the reef many fish (and other organisms) have colour patterns designed to blend in to the coral or algae. There are also a few other types of camouflage found on the reef...</p>
  <p><strong>Mimicking the Benthos</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Silvering</strong><br>
    Having a silver colour is common among fish living in the open water. The silver mirrors the blue water, therefore serving as camouflage.</p>
  <img src="https://www.reefnews.com/reefnews/news/v05n14/cero1.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <p><strong>Countershading</strong><br>
    Many species have a dark colour on top and are light underneath (think of a great white shark). This works because if they are observed from above, the dark colour blends in agains the dark blue back drop. If they are observed from beneath, the light colour blends in against the sunlight coming down.</p>

  <p><strong>Transparency</strong><br>
    Being transparent is effective for allowing an organism to be almost invisible. However it drastically limits the size and complexity of the animal tissue in order to stay effective. If a transparent organism eats prey that isn't also transparent, the "spell" will wear off!</p>

  <h2>Do Fish Sleep?</h2>
  <p>Fish don't undertake the same process of 'sleep' that mammals do, but most do have some form of rest that can be considered a form of sleeping. They lack eyelids so cannot close their eyes. When they rest in this way, they reduce their activity and their metabolism but remain somewhat alert to danger. Whilst resting, some float, others wedge themselves into crevices. When parrotfish sleep, they surroudn themselves in a bubble of mucus secreted from the mouth. This acts like a burglar alarm so they can better detect vibrations in the water if something threatening comes nearby. It also contains the pheromones of the parrotfish so that predators are less likely to pick up on their sent. Fish species that live permanently in shoals (e.g. mackerel) generally do not shut down.</p>

  <h2>Venomous Fish</h2>
  <p>'Poison' has to be ingested. 'Venom' is injected. There are many venomous fish that can be found on coral reefs. They normally have spines that can ingest neurotoxins into flesh if they penetrate it. This is usually to use as a defense against predators. Because other animals often evolve to stop perceiving venomous fish as food, venomous fish have a tendancy to be slow, sedentary and fearless. (Don't be too put off from visiting reefs! Venomous fish are generally not interested in you and only sting if threatened. Be sure to familiarise with local procedures for avoiding encounters with venom and correct treatment in the event of injection.</p>

  <h2>Fish Families</h2>
  <p>Even if you cannot identify a fish species, you can often identify it's family. Members of the same family typically share common shapes and other characteristics. Below are some of the most common fish families seen on coral reefs, but there are more.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Angelfish</strong><br>
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/d3/ce/abd3cec692e457e9a2c3370467f4b8c5.jpg" height="120" width="170">

Angelfish are among a number of fish families that have laterally compressed body shapes. This has two main advantages. It reduces drag in the water for efficient swimming. It also gives the impression of having a large body size that may be perceived as threatening or too big to handle as prey, whilst actually having a relatively small biomass and therefore not too demanding to acquire sufficient food. Relative to other laterally compressed fish, angelfish have a roughly oval-shaped front-end and rectangular bottom-end.</p>
  
<p><strong>Barracuda</strong><br>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Barracuda_laban.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Torpedo shaped silver carnivores. They can reach rapid speeds very quickly.</p>
  
<p><strong>Basslets</strong><br>

Laterally compressed. Generally smaller than angelfish and more oval-shaped from the side. They are important herbivores on reefs and have a protruding snouts that enable them to be selective with what they pick off the reef.</p>

<p><strong>Conger Eels</strong><br>

Have a generic ‘goldfish-like’ shape. Their fins are typically quite rounded. They are often referred to as ‘farmers’ of the reef. They often have well-defined territories, hereby they allow algae to grow that serves as food. They will defend their territories vigorously (including from scuba divers!).</p>

  <br>
Have a wonky ‘diamond-shaped’ body. When they swim, their body stays rigid so all the propulsion is through the fins.</p>

<p><strong>Flounder</strong><br>
  <img src="https://rollingharbour.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/peacock-flounder-melinda-rogers-at-dive-abaco-1.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Very flat and highly camouflaged. Spend most of their time on the sediment.</p>

<p><strong>Flying Fish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c8Ady7ySayI/maxresdefault.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
The pectoral fins have evolved to be big and powerful so as to act like wings that enable them to escape prey by thrusting out of the water and fluttering to safety. Their “flight” can reach 70 km/h and will typically cover as much as 50m, however they have been known to reach up to 400m if they catch the right updrafts at the leading edge of the waves.</p>

<p><strong>Goatfish</strong><br>

  <img src="https://dtmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/goatfish.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <br>
Have two appendages underneath the mouth that are highly sensitive and are used to rummage through sediment to find food.</p>

<p><strong>Gobies</strong><br>
  <img src="https://seascapestudio.net/reference/fishes/elacatinus_oceanops.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Most species are just a few cm long when fully grown. They often serve as important cleaners on the reef as they feed on parasites that are infesting other fish.</p>

<p><strong>Grunts</strong><br>

  <br>
Generally pelagic silvery fish found in groups.</p>

<p><strong>Jawfish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://www.aquaticlog.com/showcase/image.jpeg?imageId=223401&width=500&height=430" height="120" width="170"><br>
Live inside burrows that they create in the sand. They create their tunnels by filling their mouths with sand and then spitting it out elsewhere – they are also territorial of their burrows. They are mouthbrooders which means that their eggs hatch in their hatch in their mouths. This ensures that eggs are protected from predation.</p>

<p><strong>Lizard Fish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/thumb2/sanddiver5.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Spends much of the time conserving energy by sitting on the benthos.</p>

Carnivorous. Species vary in length from just over one foot to over 3m. Look in crevices for morays seeking shelter.</p>

<p><strong>Needlefish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/802/26420547507_21b23f8ac6_b.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Needle-shaped silver fish commonly found in shallow waters. They can dart quickly to escape predation.</p>

<p><strong>Parrotfish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9a/73/82/9a73821e840fb0e209ca63d27fc2be44.png" height="120" width="170">

Parrotfish have the greatest functional impact of all herbivorous fish on the reef. They have hardened beak-like mouths that enable them to chomp on the reef. They are targeting the algae but are unprecise as they eat so will consume calcified bits of the reef as well. This small amount of disturbance is actually beneficial  as it increases benthic diversity by enabling other organisms to grow on the recently exposed benthos. The non-digestible parts they consume are excreted out as sand, thus building up the tropical beaches that many people enjoy. Most parrotfish species have colours that differ drastically between sexes. Males tend to have more vibrant colours. Most parrotfish are hermaphroditic, starting life as females. A single male will live in a group of females, gaining a large amount of fertilization success. If a male is removed from the group, hormones in one of the females will signal her to transform into a male.</p>

<p><strong>Porcupinefish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/porcupine12.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <img src="https://uniquepetswiki.com/ezoimgfmt/uniquepetswiki.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/funny-puffer-fish-4-300x199.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:300x199/rscb9/ng:webp/ngcb9" height="120" width="170"><br>
Swat and box-like shape but more rounded than boxfish. They can puff up when threatened to double their size and make their spines more erect.</p>

<p><strong>Pufferfish</strong><br>
  <img src="http://aquafind.com/imagesalt/Canthigaster_rostrata.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Like porcupinefish, pufferfish can puff up when threatened. The spines of pufferfish are thinner than those of porcupinefish and are therefore normally only visible when they puff.</p>

<p><strong>Scorpionfish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/s:800x450,c:crop/18/180318-138-CDFB87CF/Humphead-wrasse-scorpion-fish-waters-French-Polynesia.jpg" height="120" width="170">

Scorpionfish are the most venomous fish family. They are covered in stinging spines that are coated in a venomous mucus. The majority are benthic dwelling ambush predators.</p>

<p><strong>Sea Horse</strong><br>
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f9/58/e2/f958e298e2aafb81dc53476f17918fc1.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
The latin name for seahorse means ‘horse caterpillar’. They are fish but unlike others, they have an exoskeleton and no scales. Sea horses mate for life. The effs are transferred from the female to the male where they are stored in a specialized pouch and then fertilized. Adults will eat 30-50 times per day. Their eyesight is very strong and eyes can move independently of one another and therefore they can look forward and backward at the same time. This allows them to both hunt and be on the look out for potential predators at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Serranids (Groupers, Hamlets and Bass)</strong><br>
  <img src="https://www.fishingchartersanibelfl.com/Deep_Sea_Fishing_Charters_Sanibel_FL_files/shapeimage_32.png" height="120" width="170">

  Bodies are somewhat rounded. Groupers are usually ambush predators that have relatively large mouths useful for sucking in prey.</p>

<p><strong>Snappers</strong><br>
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b3/da/91/b3da91952191e63a6e85be31ec49bb64.jpg" height="120" width="170">

  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Lutjanus_jocu_SI3.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Very generic fish shape (almost like the biblical fish symbol). Snappers look very similar to grunts. They are important carnivores on the reef and are therefore a good indicator of reef health.</p>

<p><strong>Surgeonfish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2017/05/Acanthurus-bahianus-02.jpg" height="120" width="170">

Laterally compressed. Crucial herbivorous fish on the reef, second only to parrotfish in terms of their influence on keeping algae down.</p>

<p><strong>Squirrelfish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/longspinesquirrel7.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Solitary fish. Very large eyes. Tend to loiter on small home ranges.</p>

<p><strong>Triggerfish</strong><br>

  <img src="https://reefguide.org/pix/thumb2/oceantrigger2.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <br>
Diamond-like shape. They use their upper and lower fins to propel through the water. They can be highly territorial. Their territories are cone-shaped and extend upwards.</p>

<p><strong>Trumpetfish</strong><br>
  <img src="https://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/caribbean/resources/img/images/species/3370_1156.jpg" height="120" width="170"><br>
Elongated with a rigid body and elongated snout. When threatened will often become vertical to blend in with surrounding growth on the reef.</p>
