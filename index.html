  <h2>Fish Evolution</h2>
 <p>We share a common ancestory with fish. Vertebrates are animals with a spinal cord. The first vertebrates appeared about 500 million years ago. These would have been very primative fish, much like modern-day hagfish. Vertebrates diverged into two lineages. The <strong>cyclostoms</strong> remained jawless. The <strong>gnathostoms</strong> developed jaws. The gnathostomes diverged into the <strong>osteichthyes</strong> (bony fish) and the <strong>chondrichthyes</strong> (cartilagenous fish, i.e. sharks, rays and skates). One group of osteichthyes gave rise to most modern fish. Another group gave rise to all four limbed vertebrates that would eventually conquor the land, including mankind.</p>

  <h2>There are Two Types of Fish...</h2>
  <p><strong>Bony Fish (Osteichthyans)</strong><br>
  Also known as <strong>teleosts</strong>, this group is extremely diverse and makes up the majority of fish on the planet. They have hard bony skeletons much like we do. They have conquored both the marine and freshwater environment. About 60% of species live in the ocean. They have a special organ called a swim bladder that is used to control buoyancy as they swim. The swim bladder contains air that gets pumped into a sack when pressure increases. This helps to keep the fish neutrally buoyant so that they don't sink.</p>

        <br><br>
  <p><strong>Cartilagenous Fish (Chondrichthyans)</strong><br>
  Also known as <strong>elasmobranchs</strong>, this group consists of all sharks and rays, as well as a few other groups such as the skates and guitar fish. About 95% of elasmobranch species are marine and they are exclusively carnivorous (with the exception of the bonnethead shark which can eat grass!). Unlike bony fish, elasmobranchs do not have swim bladders. Instead they control their buoyancy with a fatty substance called squalene. The deeper they go, the more squalene must be produced to stay neutrally buoyant. Elasmobranchs also have a special ability to detect electric signals in the water and this can help them detect prey and predators.</p>

  <h2>Circulatory System</h2>
  <p style="padding-left:20px;" >Mammals have a circulatory system that sends blood from the heart to the lungs to pick up oxygen, then returns it back to the heart before pumping it round the body to deliver the oxygen to other organs.</p> 
        <p style="padding-left: 20px;" >In contrast, fish blood goes straight from the gills to the rest of the body before returning to the heart. Most fish need constant movement to allow a fresh flow of oxygen to continuously enter the gills. This means many species need to keep swimming. Others may rest but 'pulse' their gills as they do so.</p>

      <div style="border: solid 2px gray; padding: 0px 35px 10px 35px;">
  <h2>Herbivory</h2>
  <p>Herbivory is important for removing algae to facilitate coral growth. Only 10-25% of reef fish species are herbivorous but they tend to dominate in terms of biomass. They are most common in shallow waters as they feed on photosynthetic organisms. On shallow reefs some herbivorous fish have been observed to take over 150,000 bites per meter per day. Provided that their overall biomass is high enough, they can consume nearly half of the daily net algal growth. There are a few types of herbivory among fish...

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Scrapers</strong><br>
    E.g. small parrotfish, surgeonfish and rabbitfish. They take algae off the surface of hard substrates, feeding off epilithic turf algae and taking small bits of the substrate with them. If you are on the reef and hear crackles, this may be the sound of scrapers removing the algae from the surface of the coral.
        </p>
        
        <br><br>
          <img align="right" style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 80px;" height="120" width="190" src="https://marinebio.org/wp-content/uploads/species/Scarus-coelestinus/7.jpg">
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Bioeroders</strong><br>
    E.g. large parrotfish. It is important for maintaining reef health by removing algae from the reef but also removing chunks of the substrate and therefore contributing to bioerosion. This is good because bioeroders remove dead coral and expose the underlying reef matrix that is then available for coral recruitment. Some bioeroders do eat live coral but the majority do not.
        </p>

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Grazers</strong><br>
    E.g. surgeonfish, rabbitfish and small angelfish. They also remove epithilic algae but do not ingest the substrate itself and therefore do not contribute to bioerosion. The majority of their diet is not algae but they do make a significiant contribution to keeping algae down.

  <img align="right" style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 80px;" height="120" width="190" src="https://reefguide.org/pix/thumb2/chub5.jpg">
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Browsers</strong><br>
    E.g. chubs. These fish eat larger macroalgae and therefore help to reduce its standing biomass. This helps to prevent the shading canopy effect of the algae, therefore helping more sunlight reach coral for photosynthesis. It also opens up space available for coral.

  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Farming</strong><br>
    Farming is an activity carried out by many damselfish species. They maintain "gardens" of roughly 1 squared meter. They do this by manipulating their territories in order to grow a desired algae as a monoculture, by removing other unwanted organisms from the area. They are thought to excrete metabolic waste products onto their territories that facilitates the continued fast growth of their crops. They are very aggressive and therefore also deter other fish that may graze on the algae.

      <div style="border: solid 2px gray; padding: 0px 35px 10px 35px;">
  <h2>Predation</h2>
        <p>Predatory fish are also important for a healthy ecosystem. They help to control the balance of species as without their activity, certain species would dominate at the expense of others. They also help to drive the selection of healthy genes in their prey as the weak and diseased specimens are more likely to be caught.

  <h2>Life Cycle of (Bony) Fish</h2>
  <p>Fish eggs are commonly laid in the thousands to millions. However only a very small fraction of these will survive to adulthood. The eggs often drift in the sea as part of the plankton for many weeks before hatching. Once they hatch, the juvenile fish (or 'fry') are usually just a few millimeters long, even if they will eventually grow into a large adult. The life span of reef fish varies from a few years to several decades. For example, parrotfish live 5-6 years. Groupers can live up to 37 years.

  <h2>Camouflage</h2>
  <p>Camouflage is useful for either avoiding predators or for catching prey before they notice the predator. On the reef many fish (and other organisms) have colour patterns designed to blend in to the coral or algae. There are also a few other types of camouflage found on the reef...</p>
  <p><strong>Mimicking the Benthos</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Silvering</strong><br>
    Having a silver colour is common among fish living in the open water. The silver mirrors the blue water, therefore serving as camouflage.</p>
  <img src="https://www.reefnews.com/reefnews/news/v05n14/cero1.jpg" height="120" width="170">
  <p><strong>Countershading</strong><br>
    Many species have a dark colour on top and are light underneath (think of a great white shark). This works because if they are observed from above, the dark colour blends in agains the dark blue back drop. If they are observed from beneath, the light colour blends in against the sunlight coming down.</p>

  <p><strong>Transparency</strong><br>
    Being transparent is effective for allowing an organism to be almost invisible. However it drastically limits the size and complexity of the animal tissue in order to stay effective. If a transparent organism eats prey that isn't also transparent, the "spell" will wear off!</p>

  <h2>Do Fish Sleep?</h2>
  <p>Fish don't undertake the same process of 'sleep' that mammals do, but most do have some form of rest that can be considered a form of sleeping. They lack eyelids so cannot close their eyes. When they rest in this way, they reduce their activity and their metabolism but remain somewhat alert to danger. Whilst resting, some float, others wedge themselves into crevices. When parrotfish sleep, they surroudn themselves in a bubble of mucus secreted from the mouth. This acts like a burglar alarm so they can better detect vibrations in the water if something threatening comes nearby. It also contains the pheromones of the parrotfish so that predators are less likely to pick up on their sent. Fish species that live permanently in shoals (e.g. mackerel) generally do not shut down.

  <h2>Venomous Fish</h2>
  <p>'Poison' has to be ingested. 'Venom' is injected. There are many venomous fish that can be found on coral reefs. They normally have spines that can ingest neurotoxins into flesh if they penetrate it. This is usually to use as a defense against predators. Because other animals often evolve to stop perceiving venomous fish as food, venomous fish have a tendancy to be slow, sedentary and fearless. (Don't be too put off from visiting reefs! Venomous fish are generally not interested in you and only sting if threatened. Be sure to familiarise with local procedures for avoiding encounters with venom and correct treatment in the event of injection.</p>
